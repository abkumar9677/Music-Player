# Music-Player

Hence, the project name Music Player is understandable.
This project requires some python basics knowledge and must know how to deal with different **frameworks** associated with **python**.

_Going throughout the project, you first have your python installed on your system._
_After installing python, check whether it has been installed or not._

`python -V` :- Command for checking whether the python has been installed or not.

If not, Go to environment variables of your system and add the **`PATH`** of python.exe file there.

Now, use `pip install pygame` and `pip install tk`.
We are going to work with these libraries. For more information about the libraries, go to their documentation portal.

After setting these things up, you're ready to start your **Music-Player** application.
